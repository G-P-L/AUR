# Packages for the Arch User Repository

This repository is hosting the files for the Arch User Repository (AUR) packages which are maintained by me for the Arch Linux.
When the PKGBUILDs are updated, they are pushed simultaneously here and to the AUR.
If you found any bug, please report it to the creator, because I am only dealing with the packaging and/or Arch Linux-specific issues.
